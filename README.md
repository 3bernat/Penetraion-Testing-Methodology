# Project Information and Changelog

## Overview

This fork presents a unified version of two distinct but related projects in the realm of penetration testing methodologies: the original work by TJNull and the significant fork led by TheGetch. The original project by TJNull, known for its comprehensive approach, can be found at TJNull's Penetration Testing Methodology. TheGetch's fork, notable for its extensive additions and community contributions, is available at TheGetch's Enhanced Penetration Testing Methodology.

The essence of this unification effort is to merge the strengths of both projects, incorporating the detailed enhancements from TheGetch's version into the structured framework established by TJNull.

## Updates and Enhancements

- **Integration of Content:** Merging the content from TheGetch's fork with TJNull's original methodology to create a comprehensive and enriched resource.

- **Export to Markdown:** Conversion of all notes into Markdown format, facilitating usage within Obsidian (and others), a popular tool for knowledge management and note-taking.

- **Format and Parameter Corrections:** Implementation of format adjustments for improved clarity and consistency, along with updates to various parameters to ensure relevancy with current penetration testing practices.

- **Addition of New Information:** Inclusion of new, practical information to enhance the depth and utility of the methodology.

- **Reorganization of Target Folders/Notes:** A new structure has been implemented to segregate target folders and notes. This reorganization aims to simplify access and differentiate these elements from the main body of notes, thereby enhancing usability and navigation within the project.
