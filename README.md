# Project Information and Changelog

## Overview

This document originates from **version 2** of the template created by **TJ Null**. Since then, modifications have been made, including merging updates up to the current version of the original repository (**version 4** as of now). While the core information remains consistent, the structure has been slightly refined to simplify and enhance usability.

The goal of unifying the template is to make it more accessible for others to extend and adapt, particularly through the Markdown format. This format can also be imported into **Joplin**, streamlining use and facilitating tracking changes or merging updates from other forks—tasks that can be more cumbersome in the Joplin format.

## Updates and Enhancements

- **Content integration:** Consolidation of material from other forks and resources with TJ Null's original methodology, creating a comprehensive and enriched resource.
- **Markdown export:** All notes have been converted to Markdown format, enabling compatibility with a wide range of knowledge management and note-taking tools.
- **Formatting and updates:** Adjustments to formatting for improved clarity and consistency, along with updates to parameters and content to align with current penetration testing practices and software version updates.
- **New information added:** Inclusion of practical, up-to-date details to enhance the methodology's depth and utility.
- **Reorganization of target folders and notes:** A new structure separates target folders and notes, improving accessibility and differentiating these elements from the main body of notes. This reorganization simplifies navigation and enhances usability within the project.
