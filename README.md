# Project TJ-JPT (COMING SOON!)

## Introduction

As a pentester there are many great resources, cheat sheets, and guidelines that contain a large amount of valuable information. However, it can be frustrating and time consuming to find these notes or resources that are scattered all over the place. Not to mention the large amount of notes you have stored locally across your system with several different note taking tools.  In addition, some pentesters could be in assessments that are in a closed environment making it more challenging to transfer there notes and files on there devices. Thats when I found [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) to be able to suite my needs when I am on engagements.

## Features with Joplin:

 - Notes can be searchable,  copied, tagged and modified either from the applications directly or from your own text editor.
 - Markdown Editor and Reader. Easy to import and export notes to multiple formats. 
 - [WebClipper](https://joplinapp.org/clipper/) to save web pages and screenshot from Firefox and Chrome Browser
 - Sync notes on various cloud applications such as NextCloud, DropBox, OneDrive
 - Sync notes on a local file share or WebDav. 
 - Compatible to work on Windows, Linux, MacOS, and on Mobile such as Android/IOS
 
 ## What does the template include?
 - Command Line references.
 - Personal Notes that I left as reminders when I am assessing a target.
 - PWK Report in Markdown (Can be exported into a pdf) 
 
## Instructions

Note: You must have Joplin installed on your system. 
1. Open Joplin
2. Click File and select "Import" 
3. Select "JEX - Joplin Export File"
4.  Locate the pentest template and it should appear in Joplin
