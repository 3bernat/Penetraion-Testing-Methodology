# General Information

This is based on version 2 of the template created by TJ Null, adding the changes/resources introduced by TheGetch.

The idea of unifying it is to make it easier for others to extend it from the markdown version (which can also be imported to joplin), and to make it easier to see the changes introduced and merges with other forks since with the joplin version it is more complex.
